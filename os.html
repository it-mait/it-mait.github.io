<br>Memory Organization & Management: Memory Organization, Memory Hierarchy, Memory Management Strategies,  Contiguous versus non- Contiguous  memory allocation, Partition Management Techniques, Logical versus Physical Address space, swapping, Paging, Segmentation, Segmentation with Paging
<br>Virtual Memory: Demand Paging, Page Replacement, Page-replacement Algorithms, Performance of Demand Paging, Thrashing, Demand Segmentation, and Overlay Concepts.

  <p><b>UNIT II</b>
<br>Processes: Introduction, Process states, process management, Interrupts, Interprocess Communication
<br>Threads: Introduction, Thread states, Thread Operation, Threading Models.
<br>Processor Scheduling: Scheduling levels, pre emptive vs no pre emptive scheduling, priorities, scheduling objective, scheduling criteria, scheduling algorithms, demand scheduling, real time scheduling.
<br>Process Synchronization: Mutual exclusion, software solution to Mutual exclusion problem, hardware solution to Mutual exclusion problem, semaphores, Critical section problems. Case study on Dining philosopher problem, Barber shop problem etc.
